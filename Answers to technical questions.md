3. How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?
Answer : I will first find the critical areas of the application and areas which can be easily decoupled.It's always good to automate testing in smaller, more manageable chunks.
         I will write manual regression testcases for each area.I will budget time in each sprint to write UI smoke test for those areas as well.I will execute the test suite atleast once a day using CI tools.

4. How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website?
Answer :  Just EAT application is taking a lot of time to load. On searching for restaurants by postal code , Images takes long time to load on search results page.
